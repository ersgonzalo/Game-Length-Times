Game Lengths
==========

An overall chart showcasing the length of time that various games (video games, sports, etc) take. Inspired by the super short length of time that Splatoon matches take, I was curious to create a super large chart of data that can allow users to differentiate the time spent. 


### Our Data
- For these cases, we'll be ignoring any overtime that matches go into or any extra rules that will add additional time to the match. 
- We will also be ignoring any downtime that players will be facing (breaks, fouls, etc).

### To Contribute
If you want to add to the data, submit a pull request and we'll add more info to this compendium!

### Eric Notes
I'm not quite sure yet how to keep a consistently happy format. So we'll just stick to the markdown file and a csv for easy data sorting.
