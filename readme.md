Game Lengths
==========

An overall chart showcasing the length of time that various games (video games, sports, etc) take. Inspired by the super short length of time that Splatoon matches take, I was curious to create a super large chart of data that can allow users to differentiate the time spent. A mini research project where we can compare the different amount of time that each game/activity would typically take. 


### Our Data
- For these cases, we'll be ignoring any overtime that matches go into or any extra rules that will add additional time to the match. 
- We will also be ignoring any downtime that players will be facing (breaks, fouls, etc).
- Tried to be accurate to the degree of a "complete" game. Users can always stop playing interim, tournaments and rounds can always add more time spend doing that activity.
- Sources may also be from fansites where users have willingly submitted their data.

### To Contribute
If you want to add to the data, submit a pull request and we'll add more info to this compendium! Please make sure to add sources for your data or else it may not be accepted.

If there's any corrections or modifications you'd like to make to my work, let me know as well!

### Eric Notes
I'm not quite sure yet how to keep a consistently happy format. So we'll just stick to the markdown file and a csv for easy data sorting.
